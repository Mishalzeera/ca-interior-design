# Interior Design site
## Showcasing completed projects and unique restoration services.

[Charles Mellersh's website](https://www.charlesmellersh.com/) was the main inspiration for the layout. Simple, but I liked
how grounded it is in effect. You get a good sense of presence, without too much of the floaty airiness you see a lot with modern interior design. Its not overwhelming in any way, while giving the impression of capability.

One large attractive image with a logo.

Images of a clinic, a house, another house and some restoration projects, each on their own page.

For now will probably be basic contact information for the designer, but perhaps also a contact form to send messages and customer contact info.

### Montserrat was chosen as the font for the page, and some colours based on the Farrow and Ball website. 

The colours were a bit too dark and bronzeish on the computer.
